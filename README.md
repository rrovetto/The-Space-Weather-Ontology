# The Space Weather Ontology

Scope: An ontology representing the domain of space weather to the extent it is a domain unto itsef. As such it will focus on weather phenomena in the astronomical environment as described by astronmers, stellar and planetary physicist and astrophysicists. 

Architecture: a module, usable by itself, but also part of the author's wider astronomical environment and space situational awareness ontology suite.

Status: funding, sponsors, a job, or a PhD opportunity for the author is needed to continue work on this (and his related ontologies). Please contact rrovetto@terpalum.umd.edu with opportunities, offers, and work collaborations interest.
