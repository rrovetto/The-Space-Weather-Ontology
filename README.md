## Scope
An ontology representing the domain of space weather to the extent it is a domain unto itsef. As such it will focus on weather phenomena in the astronomical environment as described by astronmers, stellar and planetary physicist and astrophysicists. 

**Considerations**: for long-term use and sustainability, the ontology is intended to capture generic space weather terms and concepts applicable to any stellar or planetary system, rather than only for Earth. However, given the state of space-faring activity, the target phenomena is largely focused on the near-Earth space weather environment. 

## Status & Access
* In-progress. Subject to revision. No claims to completeness are made.
* As a personal unfunded project since inception, funding/sponsors and work collaborations or a PhD study opportunity are needed to continue, complete and sustain development and realize the project vision. Contact rrovetto@terpalum.umd.edu with opportunities, offers, and work collaborations interest. 
* Donations are welcome. SEEKING patrons, sponsors, employer support, grants, funding, etc. 
* Professors interested in applying to grants with me should contact my email below; Stuentship for this as a PhD

## Architecture
A module, usable by itself, but also part of the author's wider astronomical environment and space situational awareness ontology suite.
