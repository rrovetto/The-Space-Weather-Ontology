# The Space Weather Ontology (The Astrometeorology Ontology)

### Scope
An ontology representing the domain of space weather to the extent it is a domain unto itsef. As such it will focus on weather phenomena in the astronomical environment as described by astronmers, stellar and planetary physicist and astrophysicists. 

**Considerations**: for long-term use and sustainability, the ontology is intended to capture generic space weather terms and concepts applicable to any stellar or planetary system, rather than only for Earth. However, given the state of space-faring activity, the target phenomena is largely focused on the near-Earth space weather environment. 

### Architecture
A module, usable by itself, but also part of the author's wider astronomical environment and space situational awareness ontology suite.
### Status 
Funding, sponsors, a job, or a PhD opportunity for the author is needed to continue work on this (and his related ontologies). Please contact rrovetto@terpalum.umd.edu with opportunities, offers, and work collaborations interest.
